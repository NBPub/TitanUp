## Motivation
Utilize sources of NFL data to practice processing, graphing, and interpreting large datasets. 

## Feedback
Submit an issue to comment on the analysis or code. 

## Code Notes
The primary purpose of this repository is to host the HTML page containing my analysis. 
I have uploaded code samples for my future self. They should emulate the processes used to populate the 
analysis page, but are not meant to be "deployed". For example, various files are referenced by 
raw strings and Path objects, and these have no relevance to the repository structure.
